 You must provide a sensorsDelegate when registering to the service handle to listen for sensor activation requests.
 The NAOServiceHandle will automatically copy this folder in the application and it will be loaded at the moment of register.
 If you don't have a data embedded inside your application, you need to call ** synchroniseData ** to get the data from our server.

 The power mode is used to control the trade-off between battery consumption and accuracy.

 * DBTPOWERMODE_LOW
 </br>
 
 We advise to use the high accuracy only when the service is displayed to the user.
 Otherwise, if your application is in background or if the position is not displayed we advise to use the **LOW_ENERGY** mode.
 In terms of accuracy, the position in **LOW_ENERGY** mode is not as smooth as the **HIGH_ACCURACY** mode but is more than enough for most of your use the cases in background.
