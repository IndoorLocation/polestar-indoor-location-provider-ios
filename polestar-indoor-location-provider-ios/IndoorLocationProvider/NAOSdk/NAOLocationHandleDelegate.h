 Returns the **location** of the user. The location coordinates are in WGS84 format.
 Locations are sent approximately every second when the status of the NAOLocationhandle is **AVAILABLE**.
 
 @param location: Location of the user provided as a CLLocation object.
 Course value (ie compass bearing) is set to -1000 at the start of the service and it may take up to 6 locations to get a valid value.
 Value will stay at -1000 if compass is disabled.
 If compass calibration is needed, NAOSensorDelegate.requiresCompassCalibration is triggered.
 When the compass is calibrated again, NAOSensorDelegate.didCompassCalibrated is triggered.
